## User Interface Decorators

Adds a new Decorator ```uielement``` to make the brige with the ```ui-decorators-web``` package.

This package will:
 - handle automatic Front End Model generation, according to the defined decorator;
 - perform automatic From-end form validation, using native HTML5 APIs, extensible with custom validators and custom errors messages;
