## User Interface Decorators

A TypeScript library that provides a declarative approach to UI rendering through model decorators. It extends the functionality of `@decaf-ts/decorator-validation` by adding UI rendering capabilities to models, allowing them to be automatically rendered as UI components with proper validation and styling.

The library offers a flexible rendering engine architecture that can be extended to support different UI frameworks (React, Angular, HTML5, etc.) while maintaining a consistent model-driven approach to UI development. It bridges the gap between data models and their visual representation, enabling developers to define UI behavior directly on their domain models.
