### Description

Adds a new Decorator ```uielement``` to add UI metadata to the model, that can be later interpreted by different rendering strategies

This package will:
- expose the basic api to enable each Model to be rendered according to a 'Rendering Strategy';

Extending this with the ```ui-decorators-web``` package.
- Use an HTML5 rendering strategy
- perform automatic From-end form validation, using native HTML5 APIs, extensible with custom validators and custom errors messages;
