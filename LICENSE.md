2. License Grants and Conditions

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
license:

  a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

     Contributor, if any, in the Covered Software.

This license does not grant rights to any trademarks, service marks, or logos
of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
requirements in Section 3.4).

3. Distribution Obligations

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License and include
a copy of this License in or with the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

  a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
     as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
     Executable Form how to obtain a complete copy of the corresponding
     Source Code Form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
     customarily used for software exchange; and

  b. You may distribute the Executable Form under terms of your choice,
     provided that You do not attempt to limit or alter the recipients'
     rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a work that combines Covered Software with
other material, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
case, the Covered Software must still be made available under this License
and must include the notices described in Exhibit A relating to the Covered
Software.

3.4. Notices

You must cause each file that You distribute containing Covered Software to
carry the legal notices described in Exhibit A.

4. Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

If the Covered Software is made available under the terms of this License
and also made available under the terms of a Secondary License, then the
terms of the Secondary License apply to the Covered Software in addition to
this License to the extent the Secondary License grants additional
permissions. If the Covered Software is not made available under a Secondary
License, then this License governs its use.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either
express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.

6. Limitation of Liability

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such
as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Covered
Software (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with terms of this License and do not cure such
breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach.

8. Miscellaneous

This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
held to be unenforceable, that provision shall be reformed only to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable. The headings are for convenience
only and do not affect the interpretation.
