## Section 2. AGPL Trigger: AI-Generated Code Usage

If this software is incorporated into a product, service, or system that **uses AI generation of code**, then instead of MIT, the software is governed by the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**, *in full*.

**What “Uses AI generation of code” means (any of the following):**  
1. The product uses AI to automatically generate **Decaf-TS front-end or back-end code**.  
2. The product incorporates AI tools, pipelines, or workflows where **Decaf-TS code is generated** automatically or on demand.  
3. Usage via **Decaf MCP** or any equivalent integration which enables AI-driven Decaf-TS code generation.  
4. The product uses **Decaf-TS to dynamically generate UI** for AI agent conversation systems (chat, multimodal, interactive).  
5. The product uses this software plus AI to generate software **“at scale”** (e.g. via automated bulk pipelines, continuous generation).  
6. The product or service commercializes or sells software, tools, or applications **that were generated by AI using this software**.

**Clarifications & Exceptions (these do *not* trigger AGPL):**  
- If AI is used only during **development time** (e.g. a developer uses AI + Decaf tooling as an assistant, writes or reviews code, then commits)—this **does not** count as “uses AI generation of code” in Section 2.  
- If a company builds a **Decaf-based product** using AI internally, but the **resulting product does not itself dynamically generate additional Decaf code**, then Section 2 is **not triggered**.  
- If a company builds a **Decaf-based product** using AI internally, and while the **resulting product does generate it's UI dynamically via Decaf, the product does not itself dynamically generate additional Decaf code as a service**, then Section 2 is **not triggered**.

In all other cases meeting the six trigger conditions above, the software is subject to AGPL-3.0 — you must comply with all AGPL obligations (source disclosure, network interaction clause, etc.)

## Notes & Examples (for clarity)

- A CLI tool that helps you scaffold Decaf code locally (without runtime AI generation) remains under MIT.  
- A web service that uses AI at runtime to produce new Decaf UI or backend code for users must operate under AGPL.  
- A SaaS product that sells modules generated via AI using this software falls under AGPL.  
- Internal use or development with AI suggestions, without dynamic generation in the delivered product, is under MIT.

**Legal disclaimers, warranty, and liability** follow the same as in MIT or AGPL as applicable.

### Why this is more “bullet-proof” (improvements over earlier drafts)

- The **trigger conditions** are enumerated and explicit (six bullet points).  
- The **exceptions** are limited and clearly stated (development-time, non-code-generating product).  
- We embed the MIT text fully (so recipients see their rights).  
- We **link to the full AGPL** rather than embed it (keeping the file manageable) but still make it binding by reference.  
- We include a **Notes & Examples** section to show boundary cases and reduce ambiguity.  
- The style is more “plain English + structured” (like n8n’s) to reduce misinterpretation.

If you like, I can generate this as a **downloadable `LICENSE.md` file** for you right away, so you can drop it in your repo. Would you like me to do that?
